Provides the [Docs](markdown-features.mdx) functionality and is the default docs plugin for Docusaurus.

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs
```

If you have installed `@docusaurus/preset-classic`, you don't need to install it as a dependency. You can also configure it through the [classic preset options](presets.md#docusauruspreset-classic) instead of doing it like below.
